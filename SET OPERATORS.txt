--Exercise 6: Set Operator

--In this practice, you write queries using the set operators.
--Using the Set Operators

--1) The HR department needs a list of department IDs for departments that do not contain
--the job ID ST_CLERK. Use the set operators to create this report.
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID FROM DEPARTMENTS
MINUS
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE JOB_ID='ST_CLERK';

--) The HR department needs a list of countries that have no departments located in
--them. Display the country ID and the name of the countries. Use the set operators to
--create this report.
SELECT COUNTRY_ID, COUNTRY_NAME FROM COUNTRIES
MINUS
SELECT C.COUNTRY_ID, C.COUNTRY_NAME
FROM COUNTRIES C, LOCATIONS L, DEPARTMENTS D
WHERE C.COUNTRY_ID=L.COUNTRY_ID 
AND L.LOCATION_ID=D.LOCATION_ID;

--) Produce a list of jobs for departments 10, 50, and 20, in that order. Display the job ID
--and department ID by using the set operators.
SELECT JOB_ID, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID=10
UNION
SELECT JOB_ID, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE
DEPARTMENT_ID=50
UNION
SELECT JOB_ID, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID=20;

/*4) Create a report that lists the employee IDs and job IDs of those employees who
currently have a job title that is the same as their job title when they were initially
hired by the company (that is, they changed jobs, but have now gone back to doing
their original job).*/
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, JOB_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
INTERSECT
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, JOB_ID
FROM JOB_HISTORY;

/*5) The HR department needs a report with the following specifications:
??Last name and department ID of all employees from the EMPLOYEES table,
regardless of whether or not they belong to a department
??Department ID and department name of all departments from the DEPARTMENTS
table, regardless of whether or not they have employees working in them
Write a compound query to accomplish this.

SELECT LAST_NAME, DEPARTMENT_ID, TO_CHAR(NULL)
FROM EMPLOYEES
UNION ALL
SELECT  TO_CHAR(NULL),DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NAME
FROM DEPARTMENTS;
